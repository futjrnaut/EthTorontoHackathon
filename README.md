# Understanding the model 

# Land Games are BORING
Traditionally you would buy the land and its all just a money grab by the developers with limited gameplay coming AFTER major sales. 
Users AREN'T PLAYERS, they're INVESTORS

`INTRODUCING GALAXER`
> - Command the Zone
> - Async WarFare
> - True Ownership by Proof of Presence 

### First Galaxer to Command the Zone becomes the Defender 
> - Craft & Set traps for Offensive Galaxers trying to take your zone
> - Craft and Provide PowerUps for Defenders that want to add to your zone!

### Own the ZONE, Command the DIMENSION
> - When you command a zone you will be able to put your own AR Portal or Experience in that zone
> - Inside Portals we'll be syncing Google Ads and other revenue generating advert apis
> - Galaxers who set Portals will earn from views when others see their ads. 

# AR ADVERTISING WILL BE A MULTITRILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY

# Token Economy 
> - Stake your Galaxer GLXR tokens into the [Cosmic Crucible](https://github.com/GalaxerGames/claim/blob/tests/contracts/CosmicCrucible.sol) to issue NebulaNotes used to buy Materials to craft PowerUps and Traps

Nebula Notes are transferrable and you transfer your right to the underlying GLXR tokens.

### AR meets Async Warfare. Empowering players to become mixed reality land owners.  
 
## Abstract
Galaxer is a revolutionary platform that combines AR-driven technologies with the presence of human players, promoting fair and transparent land conflicts between Galaxers. 

## Repo Structure
The Current implementation of <Galaxer> relies on the following repositories : 
- [MAP POC](https://github.com/GalaxerGames/galaxer-hub)
- [Smart Contracts for Tokens](https://github.com/GalaxerGames/claim/tree/tests/contracts)
- [Companion App](https://github.com/GalaxerGames/mobile)
    

## How its made: 

## The development of Galaxer utilizes a combination of smart contracts, oracles, the front-end framework Next.js, the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.sh) and Android Studio / Android AR tools to create a comprehensive and fun game.

Smart contracts are tested using the Hardhat and we're aiming to deploy to Oasys if we are provided support as well as Mainnet, and Polygon to establish a multichain ecosystem. These contracts define the token economy for the benefit of Galaxers wanting to take the zones and set and maintain their stake in the world.

The front-end framework, such as Next.js, is utilized to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with Galaxer. It allows users to access the platform, take their zone, participate in the Cosmic Crucible, and engage in the portal. The front-end interface seamlessly integrates with the blockchain infrastructure, enabling real-time updates, and providing an intuitive user experience.


By combining smart contracts, satellite gps, a front-end framework like Next.js, and AR tools, Galaxer achieves a powerful and comprehensive platform. The smart contracts provide the foundation for the token economy processes, while GPS ensure the accuracy and reliability of external data. The front-end framework enhances user interaction and accessibility, while AR tools augment reality. Together, these components create a robust ecosystem that promotes fair and efficient zone warfare for players to engage in their society to play rather than just become a boring investor at home.
